# Travel-agency
The project consists of two distinct applications:

I) Client-Server Application: This is a server-side application built with Spring Boot, designed to manage trips and handle functionalities such as user login, trip search, reservation, and logout. It supports multiple types of clients:
  1) Java Clients: Developed using JavaFX, providing a graphical user interface for desktop users.
  2) C# Clients: Implemented for interoperability with different desktop environments.

II) Web Application: A separate client application developed with React, which interacts with the Spring Boot server through RESTful APIs. This web client enables users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on trip data, providing a comprehensive interface for managing trips through a modern web browser.
